Equality
	is	a is b returns true if variable/identifiers a and b points to the same object
	is not	a is not b returns true if variable/identifiers a and b points to the different object
	==	a == b returns true if variable/identifiers a and b has same value
	!=	a != b returns true if variable/identifiers a and b has different value
